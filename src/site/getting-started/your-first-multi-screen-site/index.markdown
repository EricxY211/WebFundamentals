Building for multiple devices with differing capabilities, vastly different
screen sizes and interaction methods can seem daunting, if not impossible
to get started.

为多种设备创建不同功能、不同屏幕尺寸和交互方式是一件令人生畏的事情。, if not impossible
to get started.


It is not as hard to build fully responsive sites as you think, and to show

2.  Adding design elements to make it responsive and look good across all devices.
