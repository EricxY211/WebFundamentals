Building for multiple devices with differing capabilities, vastly different
screen sizes and interaction methods can seem daunting, if not impossible
to get started.

It is not as hard to build fully responsive sites as you think, and to show
you, this guide takes you through the steps that you can use to get started.  We have broken it into two 
simple steps:

1.  Defining the information architecture (commonly known as IA) and structure of the page,
2.  Adding design elements to make it responsive and look good across all devices.
