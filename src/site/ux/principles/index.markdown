To answer this question, Google and AnswerLab undertook a research study 
examining how a range of users interacted with a diverse group of mobile sites. 
The results uncovered 25 mobile site design principles, which we've grouped into 
five sections: 

* [Home page and 
  navigation](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1YRJSN1zQRR1iobemfTjIFQcRbMntOvfzBnDP3d591lg/edit)
* [Site 
  search](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1DfBlw60sUmTfAP5M72D3N9t2345x_61JOR1SBIuqY60/edit)
* [Commerce and 
  conversions](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/170ICj5uZfMpsQGwgXINa5JnibQo93SiXPo3fEbUvJTQ/edit)
* [Optimizing form 
  entry](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1UocuKeDgFvYiy6J66q8jpSGz3ANX-pq8FYPeVp2o3hc/edit)
* [Site-wide design 
  considerations](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1vtt3oyvuTqb0MwQyqHiJFFqRsWcmQflJvTKUPQslfTE/edit)

The common thread in all sections is that mobile users tend to be very 
goal-oriented - they expect to be able to get what they need from a mobile site 
easily, immediately, and on their own terms. Ensure success by designing with 
their context and needs in mind without sacrificing richness of content.

## About the study methodology

* The study was held through 119 hour-long in-person usability sessions with 
  participants in Chicago and San Francisco.
* Participants were asked to perform key tasks on their own phones. Both Android 
  and iOS users were included.
* For each site, we asked the participants to complete a conversion-focused task 
  like making a purchase, booking a reservation or researching plans/prices. The 
  participants voiced their thoughts aloud as they conducted their tasks and 
  then rated their experience with each site.
* Researchers also provided ratings based on site experience and task success, 
  and logged errors/site issues by severity.
