key-takeaways:
  tldr:   
    - Offer users a number pad for fields requiring number entry, and automatically advance them through form fields as they input information.
    - Consider if a toggle or dropdown menu is the optimal choice for each entry on your mobile forms, and always make sure they’re easy for users to tap.
    - Keep visitors on your site by offering date selection via a visual calendar with clear instructions.
    - Use clearly visible labels to let users know what you need, and validate for errors in real time to let them know if there’s a problem before they submit a form.
    - Minimize the number of fields in your forms, and autofill information wherever possible.Use clearly-labeled progress bars to help users get through multi-part forms.

## Streamline information entry

Participants were pleased when sites automatically presented number pads for 
entering values like zip codes or birth dates. They also appreciated forms that 
automatically advanced through fields as they entered information. Conversely, 
they got frustrated when they had to repeatedly tap small form fields and switch 
their phone keyboard to numeric mode.

## Choose the simplest input method for each task

When participants needed to make a choice with limited options, it was easier 
for them to tap a large toggle icon than to enter text or select from a 
dropdown. For selecting one of many options, a traditional dropdown was most 
straightforward. Choose the simplest input method for a task, and always be sure 
the tap targets are large and easily identifiable.

## Provide visual calendars when selecting dates

Participants didn't always remember the exact dates for "next weekend" when 
booking a flight. Offer a visual calendar when selecting dates so visitors don't 
need to leave your site to check their calendar app. Prevent confusion by 
providing clear labeling for selecting start and end dates.

## Minimize form errors with labeling and real-time validation

Label your forms clearly, and make sure the labels are visible when users are 
actually entering information - one participant mistakenly entered his street 
address into the email address field, because only "address" was visible. 
Likewise, putting labels inside fields caused problems if they disappeared when 
information was entered, leaving participants without guidance. Once information 
is entered, validate it for errors in real time prior to submission to prevent 
users from having to resubmit.

## Design efficient forms

Make sure your forms have no repeated actions, only as many fields as necessary, 
and take advantage of autofill. With multi-part forms, let your users know 
what's coming with a progress bar on top. Participants were intimidated by a 
multi-part form with a very complex initial step, but felt much more comfortable 
with a different, more straightforward form that clearly labeled each upcoming 
section. Participants also appreciated multi-part forms that prefilled 
information they had already entered, like their name and zip code.
