key-takeaways:
  tldr:   
    - Allow visitors to use your site without registering for an account.  
    - Offer the option to check out as a guest, and encourage registration with tangible benefits.  
    - Take advantage of information you already have, and/or use third-party payment services to make conversion as easy as possible.  
    - Offering a prominent click-to-call button can keep users from dropping out of the funnel when they need to provide complex information.  
    - Mobile visitors may be researching to convert later, so offer a simple way to resume their journey on another device via social sharing, email or save-to-cart functionality

## Let users explore before they commit

Placing registration gates too early in a site experience can be detrimental to 
conversion. In the study, participants became frustrated by sites that demanded 
registration in order to continue - especially if the site was an unfamiliar 
brand.  While getting access to customer information may be integral to your 
business, asking for it too early may result in fewer registrations, so don't 
ask for it too early.

Before offering their personal information, users want to browse content and get 
a sense of what a site has to offer.  In the study, many of the sites that 
participants rated the lowest were those where they were forced to create an 
account upfront in order to continue.

## Let users purchase as a guest

Even when participants were making a purchase, they didn't necessarily want to 
commit to creating an account with the retailer. Participants described the 
guest checkout as "convenient," "simple," and "easy [and] quick." They were 
annoyed at a site that required registration to purchase, especially since the 
site didn't explain how registration would benefit them.

## Make it easy to finish on another device

There are many reasons a user might want to finish a task on another device, 
perhaps to see it on a bigger screen, or they get distracted and want to pick it 
up later.  For instance, a career site allowed participants to email themselves 
jobs to apply for later.

Offer an easy way to save or share information across devices, for example 
provide a way for users to share items across social networks or to email a link 
directly within the site itself. 

## Use existing information to maximize convenience

For your registered users, remember and pre-fill their preferences. For new 
users, offer a third-party checkout service they may already use. Several retail 
sites in the study offered third-party payment services as an option, reducing 
purchasing friction for users of those services and allowing the site to prefill 
shipping info.

## Use click-to-call buttons for complex tasks

Offer [click-to-call](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/device-access/click-to-call/click-to-call) 
at points in the conversion process that require entry of complex or sensitive 
information.  Participants appreciated the option to call a financial services 
company to complete an action over the phone, rather than fill out complicated 
forms on their mobile device.
